Technical analysis is a method used to evaluate securities by analyzing statistics generated by market activity, such as past prices and volume. Here are some of the commonly used technical indicators and tools used in day trading to identify uptrends and downtrends in stock prices:

Moving Averages: A simple moving average is an average of a security's price over a set number of periods, and is used to help identify an uptrend or downtrend.

Bollinger Bands: Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator that consists of a moving average and two standard deviation lines. The bands expand and contract based on price action, and can be used to help identify potential trend reversals.

Relative Strength Index (RSI): RSI is a momentum indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses to determine overbought or oversold conditions.

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that helps traders identify trend changes and potential trades.

Fibonacci Retracements: Fibonacci retracements are horizontal lines that indicate areas of potential support or resistance at the key Fibonacci levels before the price continues to move in the original direction.

These are some of the commonly used indicators in technical analysis, and traders often use multiple indicators in conjunction to get a better understanding of the market. It's important to keep in mind that technical analysis is just one aspect of trading, and it's important to also consider fundamental factors, such as economic data and company earnings, to make informed trading decisions
